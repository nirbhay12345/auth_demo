# auth_demo

A simple barebone demo for implementing Authentication is NodeJS. Make sure you have nodejs and mongodb configured locally

## Follow the steps to successfully run the auth_demo
  
1. Clone the repo
  
1. Go to the directory where the repo is downloaded and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
  
1. Replace your Mongo url in place of `mongodb://localhost:27017/loginDemo` and alter the `mongoose.connect('YOUR MONGOURI/loginDemo` in the app.js file 
  
1. Run npm install nodemon in the terminal this will help re-run the app when ever you try to change something in app.js
1. Go to the directory same as app.js and enter in the command `nodemon`
  
  If you have followed through then the application should be up and running at 'localhost:3000'
