# auth_demo
## Make sure you have nodejs and mongodb configured locally

  # follow the steps to successfully run the auth_demo
    ## step-1: Download the repo to your computer
    ## step-2: go to the directory where the directory is installed and run <code>npm install</code> this will install all the neccesary node modules
    ## step-3: now if your mongodb is running on any other port except 'mongodb://localhost:27017/loginDemo' then go to the app.js file and alter the mongoose.connect('<YOUR MONGOURI>/loginDemo' 
    ## step-4: run npm install nodemon in the terminal this will help re-run the app when ever you try to change something in app.js
    ## step-5: now make sure you are in the directory same as app.js and enter in the terminal <code>nodemon</code>
  
  # if you have followed through then the application should be up and running at 'localhost:3000'
